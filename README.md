 Built a five-stage pipelined RISC-V processor core on the Makerchip IDE with support for forwarding, stalling, and control hazard
 handling, optimizing instruction throughput, achieving a 1.7Ã— improvement in instruction throughput over non-pipelined models.
 Developed the ALU, memory subsystem, and load/store unit, integrated with system-level memory interfaces, and performed functional
 and timing validation using assertion-based testbenches, ensuring 100% functional coverage and robust timing across all pipeline stages.
